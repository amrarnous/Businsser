	<h1>What Is Public Relations</h1>
  <img src="../img/Blog1.jpg">
	<p>
  We don’t buy ads. <br>
  We don’t write stories for reporters <br>
  We don’t put up billboards. <br>
  We don’t come up with catchy phrases to make people buy more products they probably don’t need. <br>
  So what do public relations agencies do? <br>
  PR agencies, as opposed to advertising agencies, promote companies or individuals via editorial
  coverage.  This is known as “earned” or “free” media — stories appearing on websites, newspapers,
  magazines and TV programs — as compared to “paid media” or advertisements. <br>
  PR agencies and advertising agencies share the same goals:  promoting clients and making them seem
  as successful, honest, important, exciting or relevant as possible.  But the paths to creating awareness
  are vastly di
  ff
  erent.  Most people understand advertising is paid for by the client and should be viewed
  with skepticism.  Articles or TV appearances in respected publications have the advantage of third-party
  validation and are generally viewed more favourably. <br>
  How do Public Relations agencies work? <br>
  <ul>
    <li>“Anticipating, analyzing and interpreting public opinion, attitudes and issues that might impact, for
    good or ill, the operations and plans of the organization.</li>
    <li>Counseling management at all levels in the organization with regard to policy decisions, courses of
    action and communication, taking into account their public ramifications and the organization’s
    social or citizenship responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Researching, conducting and evaluating, on a continuing basis, programs of action and
    communication to achieve the informed public understanding necessary to the success of an
    organization’s aims. These may include marketing; financial; fund raising; employee, community or
    government relations; and other programs.</li>
    <li>Planning and implementing the organization’s efforts to influence or change public policy. Setting
    objectives, planning, budgeting, recruiting and training staff
    , developing facilities — in short,
    managing the resources needed to perform all of the above.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That’s a good overview of the general functions of a public relations agency.  The tactics include some or
  all of the following: </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Write and distribute press releases</li>
      <li>Speech writing</li>
      <li>Write pitches (less formal than press releases) about a firm and send them directly to journalists</li>
      <li>Create and execute special events designed for public outreach and media relations</li>
      <li>Conduct market research on the firm or the firm’s messaging</li>
      <li>Expansion of business contacts via personal networking or attendance and sponsoring at events</li>
      <li>Copy writing and blogging for the web (internal or external sites)</li>
      <li>Crisis public relations strategies</li>
      <li>Social media promotions and responses to negative opinions online</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Firms and individuals should hire a public relations agency when they want to protect, enhance or build
    their reputations through the media.  A good agency or PR practitioner can analyze the organization, find
    the positive messages and translate those messages into positive media stories.  When the news is bad,
    an agency can formulate the best response and mitigate the damage.</p>
  </ul>
